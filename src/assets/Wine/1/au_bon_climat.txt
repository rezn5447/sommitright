I had the pleasure of doing a tasting at au bon climate this week. This Pinot noir was one of my favorites. Light bodied, with some minerality and some ripe cherry on the nose. Limited cases produced. I recommend this wine with an appetizer before dinner or if you want a red wine on a hot day ?????? #winery #wineandsunsets #glasses #goodvibes #wine #winetime #winetasting #winebarrels #pinotnoir #santamaria #california #sommelier #sommelierlife #santabarbara #redwine #goodwine #recommend #yummy
